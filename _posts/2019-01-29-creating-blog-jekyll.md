How many of you had the need to create a quick blog for a school project, a
hackathon, or a work project but had no time to learn how to use a new complex
Content Management System (CMS) like [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) or
[Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.com/) from scratch?

As the new [Developer Advocacy team @
Oracle](https://medium.com/@lucaiannario/joining-a-developer-advocacy-team-f4c376d1b960)
was created, we wanted to make sure we have a reliable way to publish our own
stories, tutorials, code samples, and reference architectures.

Publishing content on Medium or similar platforms is great, but we would also
like to start using our own “branding” — therefore we were looking for something
like a customizable CMS but easier to use and quicker to deploy.

We have found an easy solution to achieve our goal: [Jekyll
](https://jekyllrb.com/)+ [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Jekyll

Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. It allows you to write
content with your favorite markup language, e.g. Markdown, and generate a
navigable website in seconds.

Through themes and templates (or layouts), it is possible to customize the
“look&feel” of your site, as well as the navigation and additional features like
social media sharing. It also allows you to have a (client-side JavaScript
based) Search functionality which is something great you would not expect from a
static HTML website.

Installing Jekyll on your machine it’s very easy and you can find the quick
start documentation [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

#### Windows users

Windows users are required to install some additional dependencies for Jekyll to
work properly. In order to do so, make sure to add the following lines to the
Gemfile:

~~~ ruby
gem 'tzinfo' if Gem.win_platform?
gem 'tzinfo-data' if Gem.win_platform?
gem 'wdm', '>= 0.1.0 if Gem.win_platform?
~~~

This will allow installing additional Ruby gems that are needed on Windows only.
After adding these lines, make sure to run `bundle update`. Additional
information can be found
[here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/).

### GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service designed to host your personal,
organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository. It is possible
to host a Jekyll generated website for free just using a regular GitHub
repository.

After creating a new GitHub repository, it is possible to enable the GitHub Page
functionality through its settings and your website will be immediately
available at *https://<repo_name>.github.io*. You only need to make sure the
repository name ends with “github.io”.

In our case, the website is available at
[https://oci-tutorials.github.io](https://oci-tutorials.github.io/), while the
source content is stored at the corresponding repository
[https://github.com/oci-tutorials/oci-tutorials.github.io](https://github.com/oci-tutorials/oci-tutorials.github.io).

If you browse to the GitHub repository, you can see it contains a bunch of
static HTML files, CSS, and YAML files. HTML is generated by Jekyll starting
from the Markdown files added to the `_posts` folder.

### Final result

As you can see below, this is the site generated from our GitHub repository
containing Markdown content. Within a few hours, we were able to have a new site
up and running, which will enable us to reach out as many developers as we can.

to reach out and let us know.
