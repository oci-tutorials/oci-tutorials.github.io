## About me

Hey Everyone, my name is Brian Mathews and I am part of [Developer Advocacy team within Oracle](https://medium.com/@brianbmathews/a-look-inside-the-life-of-a-developer-advocate-3c31cd6e0640), based in Dublin.

My background is in Software Engineering (BSc), I graduated a few years and went straight into a role in development and support in the same company where I had completed my Internship as part of my degree. I have experience with enterprise scale developments all the way down to smaller personal automation scripts for random things in my house

Having been born in Ireland and spending my life so far here I have always been used to clouds so naturally, I was drawn cloud computing.

I have a passion for day to day automation of mundane household tasks, which really isnâ€™t helped by having IoT integration with my Alexa readily available.

I have recently started working in Oracle as part of the new Developer Advocacy team on the OCI platform.

The team spends our time trialing and creating some cool projects to see exactly what the OCI platform is capable of and showing the world the sort of cool application it can have for them. This ranges for small individual projects to larger team-based projects.

My current focus is mainly on the areas of DevOps & Serverless. But once in a while, I will also be branching off for some interesting projects in ML, AI, Blockchain and IoT. Wherever the tech takes me really!

Through testing and trying these projects I have gained experience in Java, Python, Swift, Objective C, Cuda, C, C++, Go, and Javascript (React, Node, etc.).
