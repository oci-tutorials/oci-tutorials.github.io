## About me

Hey, welcome to our community.

My name is Miriam and I’m a Digital Advocate who recently joined the [Developer Advocacy team](https://medium.com/@mirknn/helping-developers-by-learning-about-what-matters-ea33fd9ea0b3) here at Oracle Digital. I’m also studying to complete my BSc. in Information Technology at Technological University Dublin. I’m pretty obsessed with the world of technology.

The great thing about being part of this new team is that we’re all passionate about the power of cloud computing. Through our varied levels of experience and knowledge, we intend to enable developers in our community to get the most out of their creations.

From me, you’ll get a first-hand experience of getting started with Oracle cloud services. I’m currently interested in making stuff with Python, Java, and web development frameworks like Flask. The services I want to focus on are Container Management and Serverless Functions – but I won’t limit myself as there might be more on the horizon!

Watch this space for tutorials, discussions, videos and more.
