## About Me

I am part of the Developer Advocacy team at Oracle Digital. I graduated in Telecommunication Engineering in 2017 at the Polytechnic University of Madrid, after completing my thesis on “Implementation of a portal to optimise the quality of the processes in an user management system”. Then I’ve had different IT roles, gaining experience with the challenges that companies and organisations face every day, and realising how technology can make their lives better.

New trends such as Blockchain, Machine Learning or Big data (and the Cloud underneath), are already being disruptive in any organisation that doesn’t want to be apart from the digital transformation journey. The adoption of these technologies will change businesses, economies, societies, and our lives, ultimately. That’s why I am passionate about technology and people. We have the power to change the status quo.

Our main goal as Developer Advocates is to get in touch with you, the developer community. Contributing in the understanding of the big possibilities these technologies have, by providing new content, tutorials or sample code.

Please, feel free to reach out your recommendations, feedback or any other comments. We would like an open and interactive channel.
