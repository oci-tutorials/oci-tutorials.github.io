## About me

Hi all. I'm Victor Martin, software engineer and Oracle cloud developer advocate. Long fancy name for just a guy who enjoys writing code and sees it running in the cloud. Take a look in what we do[Developer Advocacy team within Oracle](https://medium.com/@juarezjunior/whats-is-a-developer-advocate-f07fb671135).

## What is a developer advocate for me?
For me, a developer advocate is a technologist who enjoys sharing experiences and different approaches to do things. Introduce other developers to new technologies and minimize the learning curve that we suffer the first time we face a new technology.

I do this for myself as well. There is nothing better than expose your knowledge to others to keep learning and challenge yourself with questions that reach your blind spots that you are not even aware of. That is brilliant!

## What I do
I'm part of a new team at Oracle with a great mission: share our experience building cloud-native applications and talk about new ways to do things all cloud!

In the +10 years as a developer, I've been writing code in different fields like air traffic management, financial services, integration, security for APIs, etc. Over these years I've seen many technical and organizational challenges, probably not very different from those you have.

It's difficult to mention just a few technologies these days where everything is changing so quickly and new exciting technologies come up on daily basis but I do enjoy talking about distributed systems, integration, and messaging. Recently, I bumped into event sourcing because it might make my life easy working with microservices. Want to know more? Reach me out!

Sometimes I build react web applications, ship them on Docker images and deploy them with Kubernetes… but only the good days though.

I also enjoy bringing new people to the incredible underwater world, so in my spare time, I'm a Divemaster helping a local dive centre to introduce new people to this amazing sport.

But we are here to talk about software development. So I want to make sure you have fun developing your projects because if not… what's this all been about? :)
