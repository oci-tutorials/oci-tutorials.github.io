						"title": "Deploying a Kubernetes Cluster through a UI",
						"categories": "Kubernetes",
						"url": " /kubernetes/k8s-cluster-with-web-console/",
						"content": "Introduction\n\nKubernetes (aka k8s) is an open-source system for orchestrating containerized applications. It allows automating deployment, scaling, and management of clusters for running cloud-native applications.\nIn this tutorial, I am going to show you how it is possible to deploy a simple cluster on the cloud with a few clicks through the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Web console. For this purpose, I am going to use the Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) available under the “Developer Services” section within “Compute” services.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore creating a new cluster, it is important that all the prerequisites listed here are fulfilled. Assuming we are Administrators in the tenancy, it is necessary to create the following policy under the root compartment:\n\nallow service OKE to manage all-resources in tenancy\n\n\nThis policy will allow OKE to manage networks, instances, storage, load balancers, etc. on our behalf.\n\nFor this tutorial, we also need to have OCI CLI and kubectl on our local machine.\n\nDeploying a new cluster\n\nIn this tutorial I am going to use the OCI datacenter located in Frankfurt, therefore the OKE console is reachable at “https://console.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com/containers/clusters” in this case.\n\nThe next step is to click on the “Create Cluster” button and the following interface will show up:\n\n\n\nBy choosing the “Quick create” option, all I need to enter is the Cluster name and Kubernetes Version (v1.11.5 at this time). \n\nOKE by default creates a new Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) with 2 subnets for Load Balancers and 3 subnets for master and worker nodes, an Internet Gateway, a route table, and 2 Security lists. In addition, it creates a new node pool with 1 node for each subnet (3 nodes in total in this case). The number of nodes for each subnet can be increased at this point or can be scaled up later, without service interruptions.\n\nBefore clicking on “Create” button, I ticked the two checkboxes that allow enabling Kubernetes dashboard and Tiller (Helm) on the cluster. The former is useful for debugging and monitoring purposes, while the latter allows having Tiller installed and configured automatically for us.\n\n\n\nUpon clicking on “Create”, OKE will start the creation and deployment of the new cluster on Oracle Cloud.\n\nConnecting to the cluster\n\nUsing the OCI CLI, it is possible to download the Kubeconfig file generated by OKE and use kubectl to manage the cluster.\n\nIn the cluster landing page, after clicking on “Access Kubeconfig”, a popup window will show the commands to run on our local machine in order to download the kubeconfig file. In my case the commands are as follows:\n\n# Create a folder for storing kubeconfig file  \nmkdir -p $HOME/.kube\n\n# Use OCI CLI to download the kubeconfig file on the local machine  \noci ce cluster create-kubeconfig — cluster-id ocid1.cluster.oc1.eu-frankfurt-1.aaaaaaaaaezgkzraasadasdassdzrwhe2gcobzgcztmnjwgjqt — file $HOME/.kube/config — region eu-frankfurt-1\n\n\nIt is also necessary to point the KUBECONFIG environment variable to the _kubeconfig_file downloaded previously.\n\n# Export the environment variable  \nexport KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/config\n\n\nNow I can run the following two commands to get more information about the cluster (these are also displayed in the Web console):\n\n# Get info about k8s nodes  \nkubectl get nodes\n\n# Get info about k8s cluster  \nkubectl cluster-info\n\n\nThey will show information about the 3 nodes IPs and master Load Balancer address. These can be useful in case we want to connect to any of the nodes via SSH.\n\nUsing kubectl it is also possible to run a proxy on the local machine to connect to the Kubernetes dashboard:\n\nkubectl proxy\n\n\nNow I can use any web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy\n\n\n\nThe dashboard shows many details about the cluster, including pods, services, nodes, persistent volumes, and deployments and also allows to perform operations via a web interface. As you can see from the screenshot above, Tiller is one of the services running on the cluster and has a Cluster IP assigned to.\n\nTry for free on Oracle Cloud\n\nOKE is only one of the great services offered by Oracle Cloud. There are many others that can be explored to enhance your cloud-native applications.\n\nYou can try the steps I described in this tutorial by registering a free trial account here, and take the opportunity to discover many other services offered by OCI.\n\nTry Oracle Cloud for 30 days!"

						"content": "We can say APIs are everywhere nowadays. Likely any app you build now consumes data from other apps, your own or from 3rd parties. That means you need to expose your app services to the world as well.\n\n\n\nWhy I need an API gateway?\n\nHow many requests are you expecting per second? How many do you want to allow per minute? What happens if those requests are invalid? What if they are dangerous? Do you need authentication? What about authorization? I’m sure you want TLS on, right?\n\nLet’s assume you know the answer to those questions. Now it’s time to implement all of those validations, rate limiting, auto-scaling, filtering out bad requests, integrate with OAuth, maybe OpenID Connect, TLS termination, and so on.\n\nAren’t all those cross-cutting aspects? Do we want to pollute our business code with that extra noise? The approach to these concerns should be the same across all contributors and teammates implementing the API.\n\nLet’s be honest, it is not rocket science but as soon as we start implementing these new features, someone is going ask for configuration parameters and visibility of the process. At that point, it might be out of hand.\n\nSome of the APIs endpoints would be public, other private. That would change and someone has to implement and enforce those policies. If you are building layers of microservices to provide internal and external services for other apps. It’s getting complicated.\n\nLet’s try an API gateway\n\nWhat if we centralize the APIs of all your apps in a single place where you can configure non-functional requirements and manage policies, handle all the request per second and limit them to a threshold. Monitoring the result. The same way a reverse proxy works the API gateway can redirect the requests to the correct app inside your infrastructure. Imagine that you can handle TLS termination there to simplify the logic in your code. You don’t need to handle all the authentication and authorization in every app independently.\n\nThe good news is that API Gateway is exactly what you need. Manage hundreds of APIs from different systems in a centralized place. Even for a single API I would recommend it, you gain some insights about what the users are doing with your APIs and stop attacks in a lot of scenarios.\n\nEven more, after a few months your API is getting traction, maybe you can implement some extra features for those that are willing to pay for some advanced features. API gateway can give you an easy way to analyze the requests and even monetize those fancy new ideas.\n\nTrade-offs\n\nNow that you are happy bringing in a new API gateway, you have to make sure the routing is correct at deployment time. You don’t want to have a call because some user can reach out your API.\n\nYour API gateway should have the capacity to handle all the requests and be resilient. Think about what infrastructure is needed. Load balancer, metrics and alerts, and so on. Keep in mind that the complexity doesn’t disappear, it is moved to a place where you can manage more easily.\n\nTry in the cloud\n\nSome services in the cloud are available to handle all of this complexity for you. If you want to explore some options, feel free to play around with API platform cloud. It’s part of the catalog of cloud services that Oracle offers. See more on API Platform.\n\nCreate a free trial account!\n\nHappy hacking!\n\n\n\n\n  Victor Martin @victorilloleon\n\n  Software engineer and Oracle developer advocate.\nLong fancy name for just a guy who enjoys writing code and see it running in the cloud."

						"content": "##About Us\n\nMany people don’t use Jekyll for client projects as non-developers would traditionally have to learn HTML, Markdown and Liquid to update content. In this tutorial, we give non-developers an easy way to update Jekyll sites with CloudCannon.\n\nWhy we are?\n\nCloudCannon is cloud content management system and hosting provider for Jekyll websites. A developer uploads a Jekyll site in the browser or by syncing with GitHub, Bitbucket or Dropbox. CloudCannon then builds the site, hosts it and provides an interface for non-technical users to update content.\n\nHow we can help?\n\nTo begin, we need to create a CloudCannon account and create our first site. Head over to CloudCannon and click the Get Started Free button:\n\nEnter your details into the sign up form:\n\nOnce we’ve signed up we’re taken to our dashboard. Click Create Site:\n\nEnter a name for the site. I’m going to use the site from the Converting a static site to Jekyll cast so I’ll call it Creative:\n\nThis creates the site and gives us options for uploading our files. If you’d like to use the same site I’m using you can download it here.\n\nThere’s a number of ways of getting your files on CloudCannon. To keep things simple we’re just going to upload a folder from our local computer. Click on the folder icon. Note: folder upload is only supported in Chrome\n\nNavigate to your Jekyll site and click Upload:\n\nOnce the files upload, CloudCannon builds the site:\n\nWe can view the live site by clicking on the .cloudvent.net URL in the sidebar:\n\nComing Soon\n\nNext, we need to do is to define areas in our HTML which non-developers can update. These are called Editable Regions and are set by adding a class of editable to HTML elements.\n\nOpen index.html in CloudCannon and add a class of editable to the h1 and p inside &lt;div class=\"header-content-inner\"&gt; so it becomes the following:\n\n&lt;div class=\"header-content-inner\"&gt;\n  &lt;h1 class=\"editable\"&gt;Your Favorite Source of Free Bootstrap Themes&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n  &lt;p class=\"editable\"&gt;Start Bootstrap can help you build better websites using the Bootstrap CSS framework! Just download your template and start going, no strings attached!&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"/about.html\" class=\"btn btn-primary btn-xl page-scroll\"&gt;Find Out More&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nIf you are as excited as we and can’t wait to get your hands on OCI, you can give it a try here: Sign up free and get $300 Free Credit."
